# Lunacord
Windows XP but it's Discord.  
Made for [Powercord](https://powercord.dev) and [Vizality](https://vizality.com).

## I use Discord zoomed out and the window buttons look bad
Open the theme and change the variable at the top to your zoom level.
```scss
$zoom-level: 1;
```
### Common zoom values:
|Zoom value|Description|
|-|-|
|`1`|Default zoom. `Ctrl 0`|
|`0.8`|Zoomed out one level. `Ctrl 0, Ctrl -`|
|`0.7`|Zoomed out two levels. `Ctrl 0, Ctrl -, Ctrl -`|
|`1.2`|Zoomed in one level. `Ctrl 0, Ctrl +`
|`1.3`|Zoomed in two levels. `Ctrl 0, Ctrl +, Ctrl +`|
